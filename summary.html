									<h2>What is this section?</h2>
									<p>In this section, I wanted to take the time to give a thousand-foot overview of the content, and the general direction of the thoughts. It's similar to the about page, but rather than talking about the idea of this resource, this page will talk about the specific content, and its direction.</p>

                                    <p>The main tools we will be using to start things off are our skills of observations, and pattern recognition (and making inferences.</p>

                                    <p>But before going further, we need to discuss the obvious flaw of pattern recognition and inferences, which is "We don't know for sure."</p>

                                    <p>And that's true. We don't know sure. (If we did, we would not be using pattern recognition and inferences, but rather observations).</p>

                                    <p>That takes us down a different road though, I will address that objection in a different section.</p>

                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>As stated in the Aabout page, the goal of this resource is to help more people live a content, purpose-filled life. That is the end goal. The path I'm taking to get there consists of the following ideas:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Make some observations about the nature of things around us, and infer the (reasonable) patterns</li>
                                        <li>Take a look at the Quran, and see how it measures up to those patterns</li>
                                        <li>Then, take a look at Quran's description of nature</li>
                                        <li>Examnine how Nature measures up to the Quran's description</li>
                                        <li>Look at what the Quran says about its Messenger</li>
                                        <li>Take a deeper look at the language of the Quran</li>
                                        <li>Everything Quran</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>Observations and questions from Nature</h2>
                                    <p>In this section, we will use those age-old skills of observations, and pattern recognition, and look at things around us, and see if we can recognize patterns</p>

									<h4>Cause and effect</h4>
									<p>Everything around us seems to be an effect from a preceeding cause. Everything we have known about in this universe seems to be an effect that had beginning, and it began as a result of some preceeding cause.</p>

									<h5>Critical question</h5>
									<p>Does the universe, as a whole, have a preceeding cause?</p>

									<h4>Human morality</h4>
									<p>all humans, regardless of any material circumstances agree that injustice is wrong, right?</p>

									<h5>Critical question</h5>
									<p>Is there a single source from which humans all got the same basic sense of morality? How did all humans (individuals and societies) grow to have the same set of basic moral values?</p>

									<h4>Meaning</h4>
									<p>Meaning is so prevalent throughout the world. Everything can be broken down in terms of meaning. Individual things have meaning, and groups of those things have meaning.</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>Does the universe, as a whole, have meaning?</p>

									<h4>Unconflicting laws</h4>
									<p>Everything in the universe seems to be following a certain set of laws. I mean, just ask the physcists and the chemists and the biologists (and all the other scientists). None of those laws seem to be conflicting with each other. By that, I mean that things don't sporadically begin to do things that don't make sense by their previous limitations. </p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>Does the universe, as a whole, have a single source of laws?</p>

									<h4>Reasonable limitations</h4>
									<p>We have six ways of getting information. We have the 5 senses, and then we have our intellect and reason. </p>
									
									<p>We know our senses are limited. Sweetness exists beyond the nose, and music exists beyond the eyes. Doesn't it also make sense that there is an area of knowledge that exist beyond our reason? In fact, considering the fact that all 6 of our ways of getting information are mutually exclusive, it would make more sense to have an area of information that is beyond all 6 as well.</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>Do things things exist beyond our abilities to understand?</p>

									<h4>Objective morality</h4>
									<p>Is the murder of an innocent person "wrong" even if no one says so? Are things, by themselves, "good" or "bad"?</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>There must some sort of objective morality.. right? Killing children is wrong, even if no one accepts that?</p>

									<h4>Free will</h4>
									<p>Does free will exist? Is it just a really convincing illusion? Even if we don't have free will, the fact that it's convincing enough to feel like it is enough. Where does that come from? How do we have (the strong illuion of) free will in a deterministic universe?</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>What is free will?</p>

									<h4>Purpose</h4>
									<p>To live life, we need a purpose, a direction where we are headed. The specific direction determines the characteristics, and the quality, of the life we live. And, I think we all want to live a satisfied life, a life where we are satisfied of things. Free will allows us to pick our own direction to search for a life that we think will bring us the most satisfaction. But if we consider that we all live in the same world, and we are all aiming for a life where we are satisfied, then it makes sense that some purposes, some directions are better than others for living a satisfied life. And doesn't it also make sense that there must be one direction, one purpose, that is better than all others?</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>If we accept the premises that we all live in the same world, and that we all want to live a satisfied life (regardless of the fact that satisfaction might mean different things to each of us), and that we can all pick the direction of our life where we might find the most satisfaction, then it makes sense that there are some directions that are better than others for living a satisfied life. What is the best direction for living a satisfied life?</p>

									<h4>Gratitude</h4>
									<p>I think we would all agree that a bare minimum decent response to a favor or experiencing a good thing is gratitude. Not only that, but it seems like gratitude is critical for living a good life. So, gratitude seems important, both from moral perspective, and from a physiological perspective. So, both from a moral perspective and from a physiological perspective, it seems like we have a necessity for gratitude.</p>

									<h5>Reasonable question</h5>
									<p>Considering gratitude is essential to happiness, how can I show gratitude for my life, my body, my health, and other things that I did not directly receive from anyone?</p>

									<h4>Observations summary</h4>
									<p>Putting all the observations above together, we know the following things.</p>

									<p>From a requirements perspective, we are looking for a resource that needs to answer "what was the first cause that created everything?". That answer must point to a being that is self-sufficient, eternal, and completely unlike anything in our universe.</p>

									<p>Additionally, we are also looking for an answer that addresses how humans all seem to have the same basic morality, as well as the idea of an objective morality.</p>

									<p>Other than the above requirements, it would be prefereable if the answer also addresses meaning in . </p>

									<p>Lastly, the answer may (</p>
