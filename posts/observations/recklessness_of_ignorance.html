                                    <p>Before we continue, I want to point out a version of "recklessness" that, on the surface, may not seem like it. And, it is particularly relevant here with the observations.</p>

									<p>To make use of the observations (beyond them being just trivia), the observations are extended into their intuitive (and hopefully reasonable) generalizations. Assuming those generalizations are reasonable, and valid, we can draw out the more useful, and (hopefully) reasonable conclusions.</p>

									<p>The thing is, the generalizations and conclusions of most, if not all, of these observations can be nullified by (what seems like) a simple question. "How do you know for sure?"</p></p>

									<p>Here, the more insidious version of "recklessness" may pop up, because the question above has a "reckless" answer, which at the surface may not seem as such.</p>

									<p>The "reckless" answer, which is the same for most generalizations, is "I don't. I don't know for sure".</p>

									<p>"How is that reckless?" is certainly a valid follow-up question. To answer that question in depth, there are some nuances we have to consider.</p>

									<p>I would ask you to consider the observations for yourself, on their own merit. The observations I have tried to gather are, in my opinion, very intuitive, and their generalizations are, again in my opinion, generally accepted. In fact, the first of the listed observations is re-wording of the law of causality, the generalization of which forms the basis of classical physics. Similarly, most of the listed generalizations, if not all, are similarly undeniable, although without explicit proof. In practice, in all known cases, the generalizations hold to be true. The only reason they are unprovable is simply due to the fact that they are reason</p>

									<p>Additionally, </p>

									<p>"Then why should we take any of these observations seriously?" would be a very reaosnable follow-up question.</p>
