									<h2>Observation</h2>
									<p>The first observation I would like to discuss is the concept of <strong>causality</strong> - causes and effects.</p>

									<p>Everything we have seen, heard or known about seems to have been an effect from a preceeding cause. In fact, this law of causality is the root of the idea of a deterministic universe - and a deterministic universe is at the root of classical physics - and really, all other classical sciences. It is a really such a basic concept that it is often referred to as the <strong>law</strong> of causality.</p>

									<p>And, I mean, really, think about it. If we didn't accept the law of causality, we could make no scientific laws, no guesses about the future, based on what we've seen so far.</p>

									<p>In fact, this law of causality is such basic concept that it has sparked debate about free will (discussed as another observation).</p>

									<p>Anyways, to summarize, the first observation that I'd like to make is that everything we have seen or known about in the universe seems to be following the laws of causality - everything is an effect from a preceeding cause.</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h3>On the other hand...</h3>

									<p>Hmm, as far as I know, there is no disagreement, as a general rule, in this observation. I believe there are some events in quantum physics which seem to be probabilistic, and random.</p>

									<p>However, I'm sure we can all agree that we do not live in a quantum universe, meaning a universe where the quantum effects are seen or felt at a macro scale. At a macro scale, we are still living in a universe where classical physics seems to be rule.</p>

									<p>If we do disagree on the observation, then I mean, again, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I'm guessing if we have a difference of views on this thought, then the rest of the ideas will probably not be of much help for you.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Generalization</h2>

									<p>The general rule that I think comes naturally from the observation is that <strong>everything</strong> (at a macro) scale follows the law of causality. That, everything in the universe is an effect of a preceeding cause.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h3>On the other hand...</h3>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>

									<p>If the above observation and the corresponding (hopefully logical) general rule seems to be true, then that raises the next logical question.</p>

									<p><strong>What was the first cause?</strong></p>

									<p>I mean, it makes sense. If everything in the universe at a macro scale is the effect of a preceeding cause, then what was the first cause, which caused the first effect, and triggered all the causes and effects we see around us today?</p>

									<p>Well, funnily enough, I wasn't the first one to make this observation. At the time I hadn't known it, but what I seemed to have stumbled upon was an age old concept, described by Saint Thomas Aquinas as "Prima Causa", and even described by Aristotle as the "Unmoved Mover". It is generally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument" target="_blank">Cosmological Argument</a></p>

									<p>So, being such large, and hotly debated concept, I moved it to its own section at <a href="cosmological_argument.html">Cosmological Argument</a>.</p>
