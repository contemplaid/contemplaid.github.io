									<h2>Who I am</h2>
									<p>Well, I'd like to think I'm a relatively rational human being, trying to live an examined, purposeful, and intentional life. Part of that, I believe, is sharing our learning and thoughts with other people who may also be interested in the same thing (as I understand that to be).</p>

									<p>This is an attempt to document and share my learnings as I grow.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why this blog?</h2>
									<p>Honestly, the larger goal here is for people to live a happy life.</p>

									<p>I think the only way people can live a happy life is a life that provides a good purpose, addresses injustice, and provides support to bear through the challenges.</p>

									<p>From what I can tell, all the great philosopies of life handle those core things. To their adherents, they provide a good purpose to work for, provide an explanation for all the injustice they see in the world, and provide support to them as they go through the challenges of life.</p>

									<p>In my opinion, all those philosopies are missing something. They all require a level of suspension of disbelief that, in my opinion, is beyond reasonable. Don't get me wrong. I think anything that attempts to be as comprehensive as a "philosophy of living" will definitely require some level of suspension of disbelief. But in my opinion, that needs to be at a level that can be defended by reason.</p>

									<p>So I'd like to throw my hat in the ring, present my own philosophy of life. Again, don't get me wrong, it also requires some suspension of disbelief as well. But again, I believe it is at a level that can be defended by reason.</p>

									<p>I <strong>genuinely</strong> do believe that if understood properly (obviously "properly" being a very subjective term here), this really would help someone to live a happy life.</p>

									<p>Before we actually go on to discuss the philosophy, I'd like to discuss some pre-requisites. The first reason for that is so you can decide for yourself whether investing your precious time into reading more will be a good investment for you. The second reason for these pre-requisites is to lay the foundation of reasonable points that would be used later to defend the parts where some suspension of disbelief will be required.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

									<h3>Open mind</h3>

									<p>I'm hoping everyone would agree to the first pre-requisite of having an open mind.</p>

									<p>To be clear, by having an open mind, I mean to (attempt to) not let preconceived notions color the ideas presented here. Since we're talking about such a comprehensive, often-discussed, topic, of course I'm not going to be the first one to describe certain ideas, with previously (mis/ab)used language.</p>

									<p>For example, the use of the word "philosophy" may already be a loaded term for some people.</p>

									<p>All I'm asking is that you judge the ideas presented here for yourself, trying your best to not let them get colored based on previous experiences of how these ideas may have been presented to you.</p>

									<h4>On the other hand...</h4>

									<p>I do understand that perhaps some ideas presented here may have been so badly misrepresented to you before that you cannot help making certain connections. Again, with an idea as comprehensive as a "philosophy of living", it can, and certainly has been, easily misused by small people to abuse others.</p>

									<p>If that is the case, firstly, I would like to apologize to you. You deserve to have the chance to be able to judge ideas for yourself, especially ideas that are critical to your own happiness and contentment. If that chance was robbed from you, that is a very sad thing.</p>

									<p>If that's the case, All I would like to ask of you is to not let those small people possibly rob you of another possible happiness. I will certainly try my best to present my ideas in a way that you can build them up yourself, rather than having to take my (or anyone else's) word. But it would definitely require a certain struggle from yourself to try and avoid the bad associations.</p>

									<p>But at the end of the day, if that's not possible for you, if the previous experiences are too much, I completely understand. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this much, and I wish (even more) for you to be able to find a life where you are fulfilled, happy, and spreading happiness to others.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h3>Caution</h3>

									<p>The second pre-requisite I would like to discuss is the idea of caution.</p>

									<p>By caution, I am referring to the idea of living your life carefully, and deliberately. To live a cautious life simply means living a life where you consider your thoughts and your actions before you undertake them. You consider your thoughts, and whether they are beneficial or harmful to yourself or others. You consider your actions, and whether they will be beneficial or harmful to yourself or others.</p>

									<p>Maybe an example of a life without caution, a <strong>reckless</strong> life, may help clarify this idea. A reckless life would be hedonistic life, where you are only looking for immediate pleasure and immediate gratification of your desires, regardless of the impact in the future.</p>

									<p>I think my ideas will only be of help to you if you are willing to consider a cautious life, a life where you think about what you should and should not do, cause of the impact of your choices. I think the idea of a "philosophy of living" only makes sense if you're willing to consider the future where your philosophy might lead. Otherwise, if you're looking for a hedonistic life filled with immediate gratification, then my ideas won't really be a good investment of your time or effort.</p>

									<h4>On the other hand...</h4>

									<p>If you think that a reckless life is a better alternative than a cautious life, I mean, you are definitely entitled to your opinion.</p>

									<p>But, if you're open to talking about it, I would like to ask... <strong>why?</strong></p>

									<p>I can totally understand the appeal. The idea of getting what you want when you want it is certainly attractive.</p>

									<p>But even I can tell it's not the smartest idea.</p>

									<p>Forget all of life. Take something as simple as "wanting to go outside". A cautious person would at least take a look outside the window and dress appropriately for the weather. A reckless person would simply head out, regardless of the weather. </p>

									<p>From what I can tell, a reckless approach is the less smart option for any choice in life, ranging from the small things like going outside, to the biggest things like your diet, and your health. And conversely, a cautious approach seems like the smarter approach for all of those decisions. I mean, if you consider any choice, isn't it smarter to consider the consequences before you make the choice?</p>

									<p>And if it's true for everything in life, then I think it's accurate to say that it's true for life itself.</p>

									<p>But as I mentioned above, if you disagree with my thoughts, you are certainly entitled to your opinion regardless of what I or anyone else thinks about it (as long as you are not hurting others). But if you do think that the reckless approach to life is the better choice, then yeah, the ideas presented here will probably not be a good investment of your time or effort. </p>

									<h2>The Approach</h2>

									<p>The approach I've taken to consider my philosophy of living is somewhat based on the scientific method, which consists of observations, hypotheses and experiments.</p>

									<p>Of course, with a topic as large as "philosophy of living", not everything can be an experiment as well (probably). But, we can certainly observe, and make hypotheses.</p>

									<p> So, let's start with observations and see where we go</p>
